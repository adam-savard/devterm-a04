# DevTerm a04 Tweaks and Customization
This repository contains the tweaks/customization I've done to my DevTerm, running the a04 core. It is currently running the v0.2 Armbian Build (22.05.3) which can be found on the Clockwork Pi forums; I highly recommend installing this even if there are slight issues with sound, etc, as the packages are much newer and updating works out of the box.

Unless otherwise noted, everything in this repository is written on the DevTerm itself, including processing the pull requests to merge the changes.

I suggest starting with [TWEAKS.MD](/TWEAKS.MD), as this will contain what I consider essential tweks for the DevTerm.
